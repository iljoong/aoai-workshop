# Tools

Add `python` tools here.

You need to add `def manifest()` for retrieving the tool's metadata and a python function (e.g., `def get_current_weather`) you want to expose to the app. The funciton must have the same name as you defined in the `manifest`.

See [weather.py](./weather.py) for reference.
