[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/openai) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/tests/Samples) | [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enterprise chat template](/azure/developer/javascript/get-started-app-chat-template)|

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either the `gpt-35-turbo` or the `gpt-4` models deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]

## Create a Node application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. Then run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a _package.json_ file.

```console
npm init
```

## Install the client library

Install the Azure OpenAI client library for JavaScript with npm:

```console
npm install @azure/openai
```

Your app's _package.json_ file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Create a sample application

Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a new file named ChatCompletion.js. Copy the following code into the ChatCompletion.js file.

```javascript
const { OpenAIClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/openai");
const endpoint = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] ;
const azureApiKey = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"] ;

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  { role: "user", content: "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI" },
  { role: "user", content: "Do other Azure AI services support this too" },
];

async function main() {
  console.log("== Chat Completions Sample ==");

  const client = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(azureApiKey));
  const deploymentId = "gpt-35-turbo";
  const result = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentId, messages);

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.message);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

Run the script with the following command:

```cmd
node.exe ChatCompletion.js
```

## Output

```output
== Chat Completions Sample ==
{
  role: 'assistant',
  content: 'Yes, most Azure AI services support customer managed keys. It is always best to check the specific service documentation to confirm this.'
}
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
