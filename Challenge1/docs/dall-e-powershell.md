Use this guide to get started calling the Azure OpenAI Service image generation APIs by using PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> The image generation API creates an image from a text prompt. It doesn't edit existing images or create variations.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to DALL-E in the desired Azure subscription.
- For this task, <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">the latest version of PowerShell 7</a> is recommended because the examples use new features not available in Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in the East US region. For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you must submit an application to access Azure OpenAI Service. To apply for access, complete [this form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). If you need assistance, open an issue on this repo to contact Microsoft.

## Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully call the Azure OpenAI APIs, you need the following information about your Azure OpenAI resource:

| Variable     | Name       | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoint** | `api_base` | The endpoint value is located under **Keys and Endpoint** for your resource in the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in **Azure OpenAI Studio** > **Playground** > **Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
| **Key**      | `api_key`  | The key value is also located under **Keys and Endpoint** for your resource in the Azure portal. Azure generates two keys for your resource. You can use either value.                                                                                                 |

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. On the navigation pane, select **Keys and Endpoint** under **Resource Management**. Copy the **Endpoint** value and an access key value. You can use either the **KEY 1** or **KEY 2** value. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Keys and Endpoint page for an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png":::

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

### Environment variables

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_VALUE'
```

```powershell
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT'
```

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a new PowerShell script

1. Create a new PowerShell file named _quickstart.ps1_. Open the new file in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of _quickstart.ps1_ with the following code. Enter your endpoint URL and key in the appropriate fields. Change the value of `prompt` to your preferred text.

   ```powershell
   # Azure OpenAI metadata variables
   $openai = @{
     api_key     = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_KEY
     api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT # your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
     api_version = '2023-06-01-preview' # this may change in the future
   }

   # Text to describe image
   $prompt = 'A painting of a dog'

   # Header for authentication
   $headers = [ordered]@{
     'api-key' = $openai.api_key
   }

   # Adjust these values to fine-tune completions
   $body = [ordered]@{
      prompt = $prompt
      size   = '1024x1024'
      n      = 1
   } | ConvertTo-Json

    # Call the API to generate the image and retrieve the response
   $url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/images/generations:submit?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"

   $submission = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -ResponseHeadersVariable submissionHeaders

    $operation_location = $submissionHeaders['operation-location'][0]
    $status = ''
    while ($status -ne 'succeeded') {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $operation_location -Headers $headers
        $status   = $response.status
    }

   # Set the directory for the stored image
   $image_dir = Join-Path -Path $pwd -ChildPath 'images'

   # If the directory doesn't exist, create it
   if (-not(Resolve-Path $image_dir -ErrorAction Ignore)) {
       New-Item -Path $image_dir -ItemType Directory
   }

   # Initialize the image path (note the filetype should be png)
   $image_path = Join-Path -Path $image_dir -ChildPath 'generated_image.png'

   # Retrieve the generated image
   $image_url = $response.result.data[0].url  # extract image URL from response
   $generated_image = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $image_url -OutFile $image_path  # download the image
   return $image_path
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [The PowerShell Secret Management with Azure Key Vault](/powershell/utility-modules/secretmanagement/how-to/using-azure-keyvault). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

1. Run the script using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   ./quickstart.ps1
   ```

   The script loops until the generated image is ready.

## Output

PowerShell requests the image from Azure OpenAI and stores the output image in the _generated_image.png_ file in your specified directory. For convenience, the full path for the file is returned at the end of the script.

The image generation APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it doesn't generate an image. For more information, see [Content filtering](../concepts/content-filter.md).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
