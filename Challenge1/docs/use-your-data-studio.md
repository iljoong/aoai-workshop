## Chat playground

Start exploring Azure OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the chat playground. It's simply a text box where you can submit a prompt to generate a completion. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities.

You can experiment with the configuration settings such as temperature and pre-response text to improve the performance of your task. You can read more about each parameter in the [REST API](../reference.md).
