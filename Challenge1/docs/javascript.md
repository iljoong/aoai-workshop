[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/openai) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/samples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]


In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. Then run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a _package.json_ file.

```console
npm init
```

## Install the client library

Install the Azure OpenAI client library for JavaScript with npm:

```console
npm install @azure/openai
```

Your app's _package.json_ file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Create a sample application

Open a command prompt where you created the new project, and create a new file named Completion.js. Copy the following code into the Completion.js file.

```javascript
const { OpenAIClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/openai");
const endpoint = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] ;
const azureApiKey = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"] ;

const prompt = ["When was Microsoft founded?"];

async function main() {
  console.log("== Get completions Sample ==");

  const client = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(azureApiKey));
  const deploymentId = "gpt-35-turbo-instruct";
  const result = await client.getCompletions(deploymentId, prompt);

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.text);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

Run the script with the following command:

```cmd
node.exe Completion.js
```

## Output

```output
== Get completions Sample ==

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975.
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
